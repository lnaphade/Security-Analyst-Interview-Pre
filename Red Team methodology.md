# Reconnaissance
```
Quality intelligence is critical to the success of any red team test. Our ethical hackers utilise a variety of OSINT tools, techniques and resources to collect information that could be used to successfully compromise the target. This includes details about employees and networks, plus deployed systems and technologies.
```
# Planning

```
Once any vulnerabilities have been identified and a plan of attack formulated, the next stage of any engagement is staging. Staging involves setting up and concealing the infrastructure and resources needed to launch attacks. This can include setting up servers to perform Command & Control (C2) and social engineering activity
```
# Attack delivery
```
The attack delivery phase of a Red Team Operation involves compromising and obtaining a foothold on the target network. In the course of pursuing their objective, our ethical hackers may attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities, use bruteforce to crack weak employee passwords, and create fake email communications to launch phishing attacks and drop malicious payloads such as malware.
```
# Internal compromise
```
Once a foothold is obtained on the target network, the next phase of the engagement is focussed on achieving the objective(s) of the Red Team Operation. Activities at this stage can include lateral movement across the network, privilege escalation plus command and control activity such as data extraction.
