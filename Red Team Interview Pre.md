Red Teamers need to be agile and dynamic. If intel can help an organization blacklist a C2 server before the first phishing e-mail is even sent, that's GOOD INTEL.

As a Red Teamer, we should not be dependant on any one framework or technology. We should have extra tooling in our back pockets to adapt.

I see too many "Red Teams" who are simply obtaining tools, and running them. An adversary is not going to just run a tool and hope for the best.

Back to the point, I've also found "Red Teams" running C2 with invalid certificates, and using domains with no reputation. Many of us in the community have been doing it "right", and we take the "correct way" to do attack simulations for-granted. My survey suggests that there are many "Red Team" shops out there that just have no clue what's happening.

Red Teamers need to stop thinking of attack simulations as a 1-on-1 fight against an organization. In a real scenario,
the blue team most likely has shared intel resources with partner organizations. Defense was never a solo fight against the dark
